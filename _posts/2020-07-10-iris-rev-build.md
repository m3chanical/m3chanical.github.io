Recently I wanted to change up my keyboard situation because I wasn't entirely happy with my current ones. I have a Logitech G413 with the Romer-G switches and a Corsair with Cherry MX Browns. I'm not a fan of either of them for different reasons. 

The Logitech switches are decent but always kind of feel a little mushy 'heavy' for me, and the Browns sometimes don't feel right. Further, my hands have been hurting lately probably because of my typing posture and the constant repetitive motions. Therefore, I decided to look for a decent ergo keyboard. A friend of mine pointed me toward custom keyboards like the Kyria and the Iris. They both looked pretty awesome, and after some thought I decided to go with the Iris Rev 4. 

I like the idea of having an OLED screen attached to the MCU on the Kyria, but what sold me on the Iris was the extra row of keys. Basically I felt I could ease into the keyboard more with the extra row and keys to help me transition. 

This documents my build. 

# Materials

* [Iris Rev 4 PCBs](https://keeb.io/collections/keyboard-pcbs/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard)
* [Cherry MX Red Switches](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1027)
* [Stainless Steel plates](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-case-plates)
* Acrylic Middle Layer, tented
    * Same link for the plates, select a different product.
* [Silver w/ Sheath TRRS Cable](https://keeb.io/products/trrs-cable?variant=46391966598)
* [USB-C cable](https://keeb.io/products/usb-c-cable)
* Rotary Encoder

Total: ~$200. This could certainly be much cheaper but I went with the stainless steel plates which aren't cheap. 3D printing or otherwise building my own case would have dropped the price significantly. 

I ordered two sets of PCBs in case I wanted to make a second one at some point with different switches. I didn't want to have to wait for another PCB to ship. Of course I learned after I bought all the parts for this keyboard that there are open source PCBs that I could have easily had fabbed. I will likely do that in the future.
