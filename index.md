# About Me

I am an electrical engineer who is interested in embedded reverse engineering, exploit
development, and anything cyber security related. I know a bit about
many things and in general I'm interested in simply learning.

This page is a major work in progress right now, but I intend to make
pages on this blog of the various projects I get up to.

## Nixie Tubes

When I was in the Navy I was tasked with throwing away a large box of
vacuum tubes. However, there were many military equivalent nixie tubes
in the box that I was allowed to take home. I have two of one type that
I intend to use as a nixie tube thermometer!
